py-sinkhole=Outfall
py-gas-vent=Exhaust pipe

[entity-description]
py-burner=Final destination of whatever you no longer need. You can collect the ashes.
py-sinkhole=Send those fluids back to where they came. Must be placed on water.
py-gas-vent=Dispose unwanted gases into the atmosphere.
pydrive=Use giant, genetically modified worms to transport large quantities of materials underground. To enable the transfer of items between input and output copies, they must have the same cloud ID. Requires 200MW.

purest-nitrogen-gas=Contaminated nitrogen

[recipe-name]
fractional-distillation=Fractional distillation

[recipe-description]
fractional-distillation=Decompose environmental compounds according to small differences in their boiling points. Only a fraction of pure nitrogen can be recovered.

beacon=The [entity=beacon-AM1-FM1] and [entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1] use radio signals to trasmit module effects into nearby assembling machines. Each beacon has both an AM and an FM frequency that determines the effect radius, trasmission efficiency, and power usage.\nThe AM and FM frequency sliders range from 1-5.\n\n[entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 32\n    - AM2: 24\n    - AM3: 16\n    - AM4: 8\n    - AM5: 2\nTrasmission efficiency: 0.1 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) / 2 MW\n\n[entity=beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 64\n    - AM2: 48\n    - AM3: 32\n    - AM4: 16\n    - AM5: 2\nTrasmission efficiency: 0.2 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) MW\n\nThe default 1AM 1FM beacon is wide area low power.\nIf two beacons have the same AM:FM frequencies, the signals will interfere and cancel each other out.\nBeacons do not accept productivity modules such as [item=productivity-module-3].
