py-sinkhole=Outfall
py-gas-vent=Exhaust pipe
nuclear-reactor=Breeder reactor
electric-furnace=Electric furnace

[entity-description]
py-sinkhole=Send those fluids back to where they came. Must be placed on water.
py-gas-vent=Dispose unwanted gases into the atmosphere.
pydrive=Use giant, genetically modified worms to transport large quantities of materials underground. To enable the transfer of items between input and output copies, they must have the same cloud ID. Requires 200MW.
nuclear-reactor=Generates waste heat that must be removed.
py-burner=Burns logs, trees, and biomass into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk01=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk02=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk03=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk04=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
rtg=Great use of isotopes to generate huge heat.

[fluid-name]
purest-nitrogen-gas=Contaminated nitrogen

[recipe-name]
fractional-distillation=Fractional distillation

[recipe-description]
fractional-distillation=Decompose environmental compounds according to small differences in their boiling points. Only a fraction of pure nitrogen can be recovered.

[item-name]
dried-meat=Jerky

[pywiki-descriptions]
beacon=The [entity=beacon-AM1-FM1] and [entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1] use radio signals to trasmit module effects into nearby assembling machines. Each beacon has both an AM and an FM frequency that determines the effect radius, trasmission efficiency, and power usage.\nThe AM and FM frequency sliders range from 1-5.\n\n[entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 32\n    - AM2: 24\n    - AM3: 16\n    - AM4: 8\n    - AM5: 2\nTrasmission efficiency: 0.1 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) / 2 MW\n\n[entity=beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 64\n    - AM2: 48\n    - AM3: 32\n    - AM4: 16\n    - AM5: 2\nTrasmission efficiency: 0.2 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) MW\n\nThe default 1AM 1FM beacon is wide area low power.\nIf two beacons have the same AM:FM frequencies, the signals will interfere and cancel each other out.\nBeacons do not accept productivity modules such as [item=productivity-module-3].

[description]
minimum-temperature=Required temperature

[technology-name]
py-burner=Heat pipes

[technology-description]
py-burner=Technologies for the transfer of heat over distance. Heat pipes have a decay of 2°C per tile. You cannot lose energy. this only effects the max length heat can travel.
simik-mk01=Exotic animals that are adapted for life in extreme temperatures.
